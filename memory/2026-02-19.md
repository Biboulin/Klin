# 2026-02-19 — Legal Work + New Product Launch

## Session Summary

**Two major projects tackled:**

### 1. PONSONNAILLE COURT APPEAL CASE (Legal/Valentin's expertise)

**Context:**
- Client: Ponsonnaille family (landlords) appealing court decision
- Opponent: HOTEL LILAS PASTEUR (tenant company)
- Court: Cour d'Appel de Paris, N° RG: 25/15109
- First instance judgment: 3 juillet 2025 (won for clients)
- Appeal filed: 4 septembre 2025

**Documents created:**
- **CONCLUSIONS_INTIMÉ_APPEL_PONSONNAILLE.md** (in workspace)
- Structure: Extracted ALL opponent arguments + formatted for rebuttal
- Format: Each grief follows pattern "Aux termes de ses conclusions d'appel, l'appelante conteste..."
- Includes [À COMPLÉTER PAR VALENTIN] blanks for his counter-arguments

**Key Issues in Appeal:**
1. Rapport MARTINS (recevabilité) - opponent challenges non-contradictory report
2. Expertise DUBOIS (valeur fonds) - disputes valuation methodology, average calculation
3. Indemnité d'occupation (€49,300/an) - contests amount vs original lease rate
4. Dépens (frais d'expertise) - disputes cost sharing

**Amounts at stake:**
- Indemnité d'éviction: €1,053,370 (incl. €243,370 frais accessoires)
- Indemnité d'occupation: €49,300/an depuis 1er oct 2018

**Next step for Valentin:** Fill in [À COMPLÉTER] sections with:
- Rebuttals to each of opponent's 5 major arguments
- Case law + jurisprudence supporting position
- Explanation why judgment was correct

### 2. CHORE SHARE - New Mobile App Product (Business/Tech)

**Concept:** "Bring but for household chores" 
- Target: Young couples, roommates, families
- Freemium model (€3.99/mth premium)
- Stack: Expo (React Native) + Node.js + PostgreSQL
- Timeline: MVP 4-6 weeks
- Revenue target: 1000 foyers by month 3, 120 premium subs = €43k/year

**Full Specification created:**
- File: `/workspace/PROJET_TASKS_MÉNAGÈRES_SPEC.txt` (25KB comprehensive)
- Includes: Personas, 7 core features, user stories (INVEST), 6-month roadmap, GTM strategy, competitive analysis, risk mitigation

**Core Features (MVP):**
1. Group creation + magic link invites
2. Task management (create, assign, categories, frequency, priority)
3. Status flow: À faire → En cours → Fait ✓ (+ photos)
4. Photos/proof system
5. History + group stats
6. Auto reminders (deadline -1h, retard >30min)
7. Comments/reactions (bonus V1.1)

**Freemium Limits:**
- Free: 1 group, 4 members, 20 tasks, 50 MB photos/month, 30-day history
- Premium: Unlimited + comments, analytics, export PDF, 1-year history

**Roadmap:**
- Phase 1 (MVP, 4-6 weeks): Core features
- Phase 2 (V1.1, +4 weeks): Comments, recurring tasks, gamification
- Phase 3 (V2, +3 months): Web app, integrations (Slack/Calendar), AI scheduling

**Go-to-Market:**
- Phase 1 (Seeding): 100 beta users (friends + Reddit + PH)
- Phase 2 (Growth): 1000 foyers via referrals + content + ads
- Phase 3 (Scale): 5000+ foyers, internationalization, partnerships

**Status:** 
- Full spec sent to Valentin via Telegram (3 messages)
- Awaiting feedback before design/dev start

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Freemium pricing:** €3.99/month feels right (vs $40/year competitors)
2. **Expo/React Native:** Cross-platform, Valentin comfort level
3. **Photos mandatory-ish:** Core differentiator from competitors (Bring, Cozi)
4. **Gamification early:** Leaderboard + stats (drives retention)
5. **Focus-first approach:** Only chores, not calendar/shopping (vs Cozi bloat)

---

## Technical Decisions

**Stack rationale:**
- **Expo:** Faster MVP, easy testing (iOS + Android same codebase)
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational data (users, groups, tasks, history)
- **Prisma ORM:** Type-safe, migrations easy
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging:** Push notifications
- **Cloudinary:** Photo storage (CDN, on-demand resize)

**Database:** Groups → Group members → Tasks → Task completions + Comments
- Soft deletes for auditability
- Timestamps on all key entities
- JSON fields for flexible metadata (frequency rules, etc)

---

## Valentin's Next Actions

1. **Legal:** Fill in rebuttal sections for court case (5 main griefs)
2. **Product:** Review CHORE SHARE spec, give feedback on:
   - Feature prioritization (nice-to-haves vs must-haves)
   - Pricing (€3.99 vs alternatives)
   - GTM strategy viability
3. **Timeline:** Decide if attacking both projects simultaneously or sequentially

---

## Session Notes

- Valentin showed strong pivot from legal→product work (both needed different hats)
- Legal work: Structured format helps ensure nothing gets forgotten
- Product work: Full spec ahead of design prevents scope creep
- Both projects benefit from "proper product process" (discovery → spec → design → dev)
- Valentin likes working with structured frameworks (user stories, personas, roadmaps)

---

## Decisions to Revisit Later

- Specific pricing tiers (might test A/B: €2.99 vs €3.99)
- Language priority (launch FR first, then EN?)
- B2B angle (student housing companies as channel partners?)
- Gamification depth (badges, achievements, teams?)
